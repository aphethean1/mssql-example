  "description": "Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform.\n\nSnowflake is a fully-managed service that allows businesses to store, process, and analyze large amounts of structured and semi-structured data using cloud-based infrastructure. It provides a scalable and secure solution for data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, and data sharing. Snowflake's unique architecture separates compute and storage, allowing users to scale each independently and pay only for what they use. It also offers features such as automatic scaling, zero-copy cloning, and instant elasticity, making it easy for businesses to manage their data and derive insights from it. With Snowflake, users can query data using SQL, integrate with popular BI and ETL tools, and collaborate with others through secure data sharing.\n### Prerequisites\nTo obtain the required settings for connecting to Snowflake:\n\n1.
